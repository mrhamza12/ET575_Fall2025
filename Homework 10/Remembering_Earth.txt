Remember the Earth, her skin of green and brown,
Where rivers dance and mountains wear a crown,
A tapestry of life, from smallest seed to tree,
A symphony of nature, for all to hear and see. 
Remember the oceans, vast and deep and blue,
Where creatures glide in silent, graceful view,
A world beneath the waves, where sunlight softly gleams,
A hidden realm of wonder, in our wildest dreams.
Remember the skies, a canvas painted bright,
With sunrise hues of gold and starry nights,
The whispering wind that carries songs of old,
A story told in seasons, ever to unfold. 
Remember the forests, ancient and grand,
Where sunlight filters through the leafy hand,
A sheltering embrace for creatures wild and free,
A sacred space where spirits roam and breathe.
Remember the deserts, where silence holds its sway,
A landscape sculpted by the passing day,
Where beauty lies in starkness, unconfined,
A testament to nature's strength, unrefined.
Remember, we are part of this grand design,
To cherish, to protect, to keep her beauty shine,
For Earth is our home, a precious gift to hold,
A story to be cherished, to be bravely told. 
This poem captures the essence of remembering Earth's diverse ecosystems and our responsibility to care for them.
